#ABOUT ME

Allow me to succinctly, and briefly, introduce myself by getting right to the point of who I am and what experience I am gaining...in a nutshell.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jack-DigitalExpat. (Jack Bellows in IRL mode.)
- 👀 I’m interested in managing, and eventual designing for, practical applications and platforms, such as Shopify, Etsy, Steam.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CompTIA A+, ITIL4, MS365 Fundamentals, CISCO Network Fundamentals, and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sysadmin projects or scenarios to fill out my portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me email, bluesky, mastadon

- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Asia for over 20 years. So long that I feel like a foreigner after returning to my home, Oregon USA.
