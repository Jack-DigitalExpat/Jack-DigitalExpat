Hello and thank you for opening this.
- 👋 I’m @Jack, Digital Expat. (Jack Bellows in IRL mode.)
- 👀 I’m interested in managing, and eventually designing, practical applications and modules for platforms, such as LMSes, PaaS, SaaS: Moodle, Etsy, Amazon Merchant, Gumroad, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CompTIA A+, ITIL4, MS365 Fundamentals, CISCO Network Fundamentals, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sysadmin projects or scenarios to fill out my portfolio.
- While I am doing this, I am working in tech support in the Portland area.
- 📫 Reach me by email: mail.expatjack@gmail,com, LinkedIn, Bluesky, or Mastadon.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Asia for over 20 years. So long that I feel like a foreigner after returning to my home, Oregon USA.
